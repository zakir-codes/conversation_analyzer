## Task011: Error Handling and Observability

**Related TRs**: TR015, TR016, TR024

### Objective
- Provide transparent, actionable error messages to users.
- Ensure end-to-end observability with structured logging, correlation IDs, and traces.
- Apply and log risk safeguards (timeouts, prompt constraints, size limits).

### Deliverables
- Unified error model with job correlation (`job_id`).
- User-facing error responses with clear explanations and remediation hints.
- Structured logs (JSON format) enriched with job/request context.
- Distributed tracing spans (via Langfuse/OpenTelemetry) covering pipeline stages.
- Safeguard hooks: preprocessing checks, prompt validation, timeouts, model drift capture.

### Steps
- Error Model & API Schema
  - Standardize error response across all FastAPI endpoints.
  - Include `job_id`, error code, message, and optional details.
  - Map internal errors (e.g., model timeout, file size exceeded) → user-friendly messages.
  - Example schema:
```
{
  "job_id": "uuid",
  "error_code": "TRANSCRIPTION_TIMEOUT",
  "message": "Your audio transcription took longer than the allowed time. Please try with a shorter file.",
  "details": { "timeout_secs": 900 },
  "when": "2025-08-27T12:34:56Z"
}
```
- Structured Logging
  - Add request/job context (`job_id`, `user_id`, `stage`, `duration`) to all logs.
  - Use JSON format for log ingestion into external observability tools.
  - Differentiate log levels: INFO (normal flow), WARN (recoverable issues), ERROR (pipeline failure).
- Tracing & Monitoring
  - Wrap major pipeline steps (upload, transcription, analysis, insights) in Langfuse/OpenTelemetry spans.
  - Propagate `job_id` across spans for correlation.
  - Record latency, error rate, and retry attempts.
- Risk Safeguards
  - Add preprocessing checks (file size, format, encoding).
  - Enforce model/prompt constraints (token length, guardrails).
  - Capture and log safeguard triggers (e.g., file rejected for >500MB).
- User Feedback Loop
  - Show errors in frontend status panel linked to `job_id`.
  - Offer retry guidance (e.g., “Compress audio before uploading”).

### Acceptance Criteria
- Users see clear, actionable error messages with `job_id`.
- Developers/Ops can trace any job across logs and spans.
- Pipeline safeguards (timeouts, size/prompt validation) consistently applied and logged.
- Observability metrics available: error rates, latency distributions, safeguard triggers.

### Dependencies
- Task004 → Job tracking schema.
- Task007 → Background job execution flow.
